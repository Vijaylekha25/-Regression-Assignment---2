    "Answer-Choosing between Ridge and Lasso regularization depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the goals of the modeling task. In this scenario, we would need to assess the trade-offs between the two models' performance and the implications of the regularization parameters. Ridge regularization tends to shrink coefficients towards zero more gradually, while Lasso regularization can lead to sparse solutions with some coefficients exactly zero. The choice may depend on whether feature selection is desired (Lasso) or a more continuous shrinkage of coefficients is preferred (Ridge). Additionally, the choice may involve tuning the regularization parameters to optimize model performance."
